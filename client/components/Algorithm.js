        <h1>Our Prediction System</h1>
        <p>
          Our hybrid algorithm uses real-time data from our movie database to deliver personalized predictions by combining traditional rule-based insights with collaborative filtering.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <div className="algorithm-steps">
          <div className="step-card">
            <h3>1. Base Calculation</h3>
            <p>
              We begin by blending <strong>scaled critic scores</strong> and <strong>official user ratings</strong> (from sources like TMDb) to form a solid base prediction.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="step-card">
            <h3>2. Friend Influence</h3>
            <p>
              Our algorithm then incorporates ratings from your <strong>accepted friends</strong> to adjust the base prediction, ensuring that shared tastes are factored in.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="step-card">
            <h3>3. Personalized Bias</h3>
            <p>
              If you've rated a sufficient number of movies (10 or more), we learn your unique rating style and adjust the prediction with your personal bias. For newer users, a robust ruleâ€‘based estimate is used until more data is available.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="step-card">
            <h3>4. Real-Time Adaptation</h3>
            <p>
              Every time you interact with our platform, the system pulls the latest data from our database. This ensures that predictions adapt instantly to your rating history and friend activity.
